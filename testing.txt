---------------- Questions -------------------------

Using create-react-app, what do we need to set up for testing?
    - create-react-app alredy ships with Jest so you can start testing out of the box,
      the only thing you need to add is react-test-renderer if you are rendering snapshots.
      
What components are worth to test in your development?
    - The Navigation component which renders some elements depending on the user action, for example
      the left drawe which renders when the user clicks a specific button, ListItems which renders a 
      list with all the videos obtained from the mockup data, the ChannelsRow which renders a row 
      with all the unique channels in the mockup data, and the SearchBar which changes when the user  
      adds or changes the input of the coponent, those are the components that changes depending on  
      the user interaction or the data used.

Can you apply TDD once you already created components?
    - Yes TDD can be implemented once the component is created but must be done before the component is 
      shipped to production, the whole point of TDD is to test the components functionality and avoid 
      loses in time and budget because of bugs.
